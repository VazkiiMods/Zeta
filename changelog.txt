- Implement `@ModuleInstance` (MehVahdJukaar)
- Complain when mods return null from `IForgeItem#getCraftingRemainingItem` and try to move on instead of crashing b/c I'm sick of fielding issue reports about it lol (quat)
- Pressing Escape backs up only 1 level from config screens instead of kicking you out (quat)
- Try and fix the Quark config being perpetually "incorrect"; had to do with anti-overlap comments (quat)
- Change how config loading works; ensure everything is loaded on the correct threads at the correct times, ignore config change requests that happen too early, lots of verbose logging. (quat)

Changes from older versions (which were mistakenly uploaded as 1.20.0 so you might not have seen them)

- fixed an issue with piston and sticky blocks (MehVahdJukaar)
- Some fixes for the config loading race condition (MehVahdJukaar)
